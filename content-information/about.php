<h1>About | Our Approach is Simple!</h1>

<p>Opened in 2005 by award-winning Chef-patron <a href="sabbirkarim.com">Sabbir Karim</a>, Salaam Namaste rapidly became a favourite destination for the residents of London Bloomsbury, people who know a thing or two about food. As befits an Indian restaurant fêted by critics and patrons alike as 'vastly different from the norm', a visit to Salaam Namaste is a journey into a world where the tired clichés of the curry house have no place.</p>
