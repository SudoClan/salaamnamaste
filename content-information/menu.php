<!--The theatrical open kitchen at Namaaste Kitchen allows guests to see their food expertly cooked before their very eyes in the tandoor (traditional clay oven), the sigri (coal-fired stove) and the tawa (hot iron griddle). Two fantastic ‘chefs’ tables’, seating a maximum of eight persons, flank the grill area – perfect for those who wish to see all the action in the kitchen. Namaaste Kitchen’s uses only the best quality spices for its marinades and the finest seasonal ingredients. In addition to the Indian and Pakistani grills, it also offers an extensive menu of modern and traditional curries and biryanis.--></p>
